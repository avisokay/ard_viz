# Consistently estimating network statistics using *Aggregated Relational Data* (***ARD***): A Primer
The full paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09881).

<br>

### How does disease spread during a pandemic?

### Or how does a meme go viral on a social media platform?

### Social scientists use ***network data*** to answer these types of questions. 

### However, collecting complete ***network data*** for this type of research is expensive, time-consuming, and often infeasible. 

### ***ARD*** offers a cheaper alternative to researchers who cannot otherwise acquire network data.

### ***ARD*** captures network information by asking a respondent questions of the form:

<br>

<center> <font size="5">  ***How many people with trait X do you know?*** </font>  </center>

<br>

### When observable traits are associated with latent communities, researchers can use observations from ARD responses to estimate latent community structure of the full network.  

<br>

# 1. Generating an example network.
 
### To illustrate how it works, let's begin by generating a network of 10 nodes. 

### Each node is randomly assigned to one of two communities, ***Red*** or ***Gold***.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

#dataset
nodes = data.frame(id = 1:10,
                  label = as.character(1:10),
                  shape = "dot",
                  size = 30, 
                  font.size = 25,
                  align = "center",
                  group = c(rep("tomato", 5), 
                            rep("Gold", 5)),
                  borderWidth = 2,
                  color.background = c(rep("tomato", 5), 
                                       rep("Gold", 5)),
                  color.border = "black",
                  color.highlight.background = c(rep("tomato", 5), 
                                                 rep("gold", 5)),
                  color.highlight.border = "black",
                  shadow = TRUE
                  # title = paste0("</b>Node </p>", 1:10)
)

edges = c()

visNetwork(nodes, edges)
```

### Next, let's assign a shape trait to each node; either a ***Triangle***, ***Square***, or a ***Star***. 

### ***We assume that traits are associated with community, but not perfectly correlated.***  
<center> <font size="5">  (remember this for later) <font> <center/>

### For this example, a node is more likely to be a ***Square*** if it is in the ***Gold*** community, more likely to be a ***Triangle*** if it is in the ***Red*** community, and equally likely to be a ***Star*** regardless of community. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

#dataset
nodes = data.frame(id = 1:10,
                  label = as.character(1:10),
                  shape = c("star", 
                            "triangle",
                            "triangle", 
                            "triangle",
                            "square", 
                            "triangle",
                            "square", 
                            "star",
                            "square", 
                            "square"),
                  size = 30, 
                  font.size = 25,
                  align = "center",
                  group = c(rep("tomato", 5), 
                            rep("Gold", 5)),
                  borderWidth = 2,
                  color.background = c(rep("tomato", 5), 
                                       rep("Gold", 5)),
                  color.border = "black",
                  color.highlight.background = c(rep("tomato", 5), 
                                                 rep("gold", 5)),
                  color.highlight.border = "black",
                  shadow = TRUE
                  # title = paste0("</b>Node </p>", 1:10)
)

edges = c()

visNetwork(nodes, edges)
```

### Finally, we assume there is ***community homophily*** in this network such that the ***probability*** of node $i$ forming an edge with node $j$, $p_{ij}$, is ***greater*** if $i$ and $j$ are in the ***same community***.

### In other words, ***Red*** nodes are more likely to connect with other ***Red***  nodes, and same for ***Gold*** nodes. 

### Now that we have generated nodes and assigned communities, traits and edges, we will call this complete network $G$. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

nodes = data.frame(id = 1:10,
                  label = as.character(1:10),

                            "triangle",
                            "square", 
                            "star",

                            rep("Gold", 5)),

                  shadow = TRUE
                  # title = paste0("</b>Node </p>", 1:10)
)

edges = data.frame(from = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10),
                  to   = c(3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8, 8, 9, 10, 8))

visNetwork(nodes, edges)
```

### $G$ is what a researcher would oberve if they could collect complete network data.

### In this example however, the researcher can only directly observe traits, not communities or edges between individual nodes. We call this observed network $G^{*}$.

# 2. Gathering Aggregated Relational Data (***ARD***)

### Recall that ***ARD*** is collected by asking nodes in a network questions of the form *How many people with trait X do you know?* 

### In this example, the researcher would ask each node: How many ***Triangles*** do you know? How many ***Squares***? How many ***Stars***?

### Asking each node $i$ in $G^{*}$ how many of their neighbors have a given ***trait***  produces a single ARD response $y_i$.

### For example, node 4's ARD response, $y_4$ is two ***Triangles*** and one ***Square*** while $y_8$ is three ***Sqares*** and one ***Triangle***. 

### Aggregating all responses $y_i$ yields the following ***ARD*** table, $Y$.

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ARD %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = T)
```

### 3. Estimating Community Structure using ***ARD***

### Now we can use ***ARD*** responses $Y$ we gathered above to estimate latent groups for the complete network.

### First, we cluster nodes into communities $C_1$ and $C_2$ based on their ***ARD*** response $y_i$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("communities.PNG")

```

### There are many methods researchers could use for this clustering, but for this example we simply put ***Triangles*** together into $C_1$, ***Squares*** together into $C_2$, and one ***Star*** in each at random since there are only two. 

### Then we calculate the fraction of each trait in each community. So in our example we have

```{r, echo = FALSE}

community_fraction = data.frame(C1 = c("20%", "0%", "80%"),
                                C2 = c("20%", "80%", "0%"))
rownames(community_fraction) = c("Star", "Square", "Triangle")

community_fraction %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), 
                # full_width = FALSE,
                position = "center")
```

### For each ARD response $y_i$ we disaggregete by trait and calculate the fraction of $y_i$'s contacts with each trait.

<center> <font size = 5> Disaggregating ARD response $y_8$ <font> <center/>
```{r, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("disaggregate.PNG")

```

### 75% of $y_8$'s contatcts are ***Squares***, and 25% are ***Triangles***.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("probability.PNG")

```

### We use this fraction to estimate latent group status for all of the nodes in the graph.

                  shadow = TRUE
                  # title = paste0("</b>Node </p>", 1:10)
)

edges = data.frame(from = c(1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10),
                  to   = c(3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 2, 8, 8, 9, 10, 8))

visNetwork(nodes, edges)
```


### Remember how we assumed that observable ***traits*** are associated with latent group membership? We can use this assumption to take the ***ARD*** responses to classify group status for each node $i$. 

### For example, if ***ARD*** response $y_i$ knows multiple squares, node $i$ is probably part in the ***Yellow*** community. On the other hand, if $y_i$ knows multiple triangles, node $i$ probably belongs to ***Red***.

### $Y$ is used to fit a model, $\hat\theta$, which detects the number of latent groups and classifies latent group membership for each node in $G^{*}$.
